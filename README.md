# HTML/CSS/JavaScript Workshop Demo
This repository contains the demo for HackUCI's Vanilla JS workshop on 11/3/2022.

## Project
We will be making a simple calculator website that utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript. We will have two numeric inputs and one select input for the 4 operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

## Installation
- No installation is needed! Just drag the HTML file into your browser.
- If you use VSCode, there is a great [extension](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/) that makes developing frontend apps much easier. Any change you make will be directly reflected in the website instead of you having to drag the HTML file into your browser agian.
